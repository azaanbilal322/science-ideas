<div class="box">
<h2>About Science Ideas</h2>
<p>
Science Ideas is my personal educational platform created to share knowledge
about science, electronics, coding, and modern technology in a simple and
easy-to-understand way. This platform is specially designed for school
students and beginners who want to learn practical technology instead of
only reading theory from books.
</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>Science Ideas as a Learning Platform</h2>
<p>
Science Ideas is not just a YouTube channel, but a complete learning platform
where students can understand how real electronic systems work. Through
videos and explanations, this platform helps students connect classroom
science with real-life applications, making learning more interesting
and meaningful.
</p>

<div class="box">
<h2>What is Coding?</h2>
<p>
Coding is the process of writing instructions for a machine so that it can
perform a specific task. In electronics, coding is used to control hardware
components like LEDs, motors, sensors, and displays. Coding helps students
understand logic, sequencing, and problem-solving, which are very important
skills in today’s technology-driven world.
</p>

<div class="box">
<h2>Arduino Uno</h2>
<p>
Arduino Uno is a beginner-friendly microcontroller board that is widely used
in schools and science projects. It helps students learn how electronic
components work together with software. Arduino Uno is perfect for learning
basic coding, understanding sensors, and building simple robotics and
automation projects.
</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>NodeMCU (ESP8266)</h2>
<p>
NodeMCU is a development board based on the ESP8266 microcontroller that comes
with built-in Wi-Fi. It allows electronic projects to connect to the internet
and send or receive data online. NodeMCU is commonly used in IoT projects such
as smart home automation, remote monitoring, and wireless control systems.
</p>
</div>

<!-- 6 -->
<div class="box">
<h2>ESP32</h2>
<p>
ESP32 is an advanced microcontroller that includes both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
features. It is faster and more powerful than Arduino Uno and NodeMCU.
ESP32 is used in modern projects like smart devices, robotics, real-time
data processing, and AI-based systems. It helps students learn advanced
technology used in the real world.
